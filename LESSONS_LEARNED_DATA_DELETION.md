# Lessons Learned: Critical Data Deletion Incident

## üìã Incident Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: Production admin panel completely broken - all pages showing ImportError
**Duration**: ~2 hours (detection to full resolution)
**Root Cause**: Physical deletion of all Python module files in `data/database/` directory on production server

---

## üî¥ Incident Timeline

### Initial Symptoms (16:00 UTC)
- Admin panel pages returning HTTP 200 but showing blank content
- Error message: `Error importing: No module named 'utils.database'`
- All 6 pages affected: Dashboard, Grants, Users, Analytics, Agents, Settings

### Investigation Phase (16:05-16:25 UTC)

#### Initial Hypothesis: PYTHONPATH Misconfiguration
```bash
# Checked systemd service configuration
cat /etc/systemd/system/grantservice-admin.service

# ‚úÖ PYTHONPATH was correctly set:
Environment="PYTHONPATH=/var/GrantService:/var/GrantService/web-admin:/var/GrantService/data:..."
```

**Result**: PYTHONPATH was correct - hypothesis rejected

#### Second Hypothesis: Import Chain Error
```python
# Traced import chain:
app_main.py
  ‚Üí utils/database.py
    ‚Üí from data.database import GrantServiceDatabase  # FAILS HERE
```

Checked `utils/database.py` - imports looked correct.

#### Discovery of Root Cause (16:20 UTC)
```bash
# Checked local environment (Windows)
$ ls data/database/
__init__.py  agents.py  auth.py  interview.py  models.py  prompts.py
researcher.py  sessions.py  user_progress.py  users.py  ‚úÖ

# Checked production environment (Linux)
$ ssh root@5.35.88.251 "ls /var/GrantService/data/database/"
user_progress.py  ‚ùå ONLY THIS FILE!

# Git status revealed the truth
$ ssh root@5.35.88.251 "cd /var/GrantService && git status data/database/"
deleted:    data/database/__init__.py
deleted:    data/database/models.py
deleted:    data/database/auth.py
deleted:    data/database/agents.py
deleted:    data/database/interview.py
deleted:    data/database/researcher.py
deleted:    data/database/sessions.py
deleted:    data/database/users.py
deleted:    data/database/prompts.py
```

**üîë KEY INSIGHT**: Files were physically deleted from filesystem, not just corrupted or misconfigured.

## üéØ Root Cause Analysis

### What Happened

**All critical Python module files in `data/database/` were deleted from production server, except `user_progress.py`.**

### Missing Files
```
data/database/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py          ‚ùå DELETED (makes directory a Python module)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py            ‚ùå DELETED (contains GrantServiceDatabase class)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.py              ‚ùå DELETED
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents.py            ‚ùå DELETED
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interview.py         ‚ùå DELETED
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ researcher.py        ‚ùå DELETED
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sessions.py          ‚ùå DELETED
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users.py             ‚ùå DELETED
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts.py           ‚ùå DELETED
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user_progress.py     ‚úÖ SURVIVED
```

### Why System Failed

1. **Missing `__init__.py`**: Directory no longer recognized as Python package
2. **Missing `models.py`**: Core `GrantServiceDatabase` class unavailable
3. **Import chain broken**: All pages depend on these modules

### Why PYTHONPATH Couldn't Help

```python
# PYTHONPATH tells Python WHERE to look for modules
sys.path = [..., '/var/GrantService/data', ...]

# But if files don't physically exist, Python can't import them
from data.database import GrantServiceDatabase  # ‚ùå File not found!
```

**You can't import files that don't exist, no matter how correct your PYTHONPATH is.**

---

## ‚úÖ Resolution

### Immediate Fix (16:25 UTC)
```bash
# Restore deleted files from git repository
cd /var/GrantService
git restore data/database/

# Verify restoration
ls data/database/
# ‚úÖ All 10 files now present

# Clear Python cache to ensure clean imports
find . -type d -name '__pycache__' -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -type f -name '*.pyc' -delete

# Restart service with fresh imports
systemctl restart grantservice-admin
```

### Verification (16:30 UTC)
```bash
# Check for import errors in logs
journalctl -u grantservice-admin --since '1 minute ago' | grep ImportError
# ‚úÖ No errors found

# Verify all pages responding
curl -I https://grantservice.onff.ru/üë•_–ü–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK ‚úÖ

curl -I https://grantservice.onff.ru/üìÑ_–ì—Ä–∞–Ω—Ç—ã
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK ‚úÖ

# All 6 pages tested - all returning 200 ‚úÖ
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Preventive Measures Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow File Verification

**Added to `.github/workflows/deploy-grantservice.yml`** (Lines 99-146):

```yaml
# ========================================
# –ö–†–ò–¢–ò–ß–ï–°–ö–ê–Ø –ü–†–û–í–ï–†–ö–ê: Verify critical files exist
# ========================================
echo "Verifying critical Python modules..."
MISSING_FILES=0

# –ü—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Ä–∫–∞ data/database/ –º–æ–¥—É–ª–µ–π
if [ ! -f "data/database/__init__.py" ]; then
  echo "‚úó ERROR: data/database/__init__.py is MISSING!"
  MISSING_FILES=1
else
  echo "‚úì data/database/__init__.py exists"
fi

if [ ! -f "data/database/models.py" ]; then
  echo "‚úó ERROR: data/database/models.py is MISSING!"
  MISSING_FILES=1
else
  echo "‚úì data/database/models.py exists"
fi

if [ ! -f "data/database/auth.py" ]; then
  echo "‚úó ERROR: data/database/auth.py is MISSING!"
  MISSING_FILES=1
else
  echo "‚úì data/database/auth.py exists"
fi

# –ï—Å–ª–∏ —Ñ–∞–π–ª—ã –æ—Ç—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—Ç - –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞–≤–ª–∏–≤–∞–µ–º –∏–∑ git
if [ $MISSING_FILES -eq 1 ]; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL: Missing core Python modules detected!"
  echo "Restoring from git repository..."
  git restore data/database/

  # –ü–æ–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–Ω–∞—è –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Ä–∫–∞
  if [ -f "data/database/models.py" ]; then
    echo "‚úì Files successfully restored from git"
  else
    echo "‚úó FATAL: Cannot restore critical files - deployment ABORTED"
    exit 1
  fi
fi

# –û—á–∏—Å—Ç–∫–∞ Python –∫—ç—à–∞ –¥–ª—è —á–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≥–æ –∏–º–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞
echo "Clearing Python cache..."
find . -type d -name '__pycache__' -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true
find . -type f -name '*.pyc' -delete 2>/dev/null || true
echo "‚úì Python cache cleared"
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Detects missing files before service restart
- ‚úÖ Automatically restores from git if possible
- ‚úÖ Aborts deployment if restoration fails
- ‚úÖ Clears Python cache to prevent import issues

### 2. Headless Browser Testing

**Created `scripts/headless_check.py`**:
- Uses Playwright to test all 6 admin pages
- Checks HTTP status, expected content, and error messages
- Runs after every deployment to verify functionality

**Created `scripts/quick_pages_check.sh`**:
- Fast curl-based health checks
- No dependencies beyond curl
- Can run on any system

**Updated `.claude/agents/deployment-manager.md`**:
- Added headless testing to deployment workflow
- Automated post-deployment verification

### 3. Enhanced Monitoring

**Added to deployment workflow**:
```bash
# –§–∏–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Ä–∫–∞ –ë–î
echo "Verifying production database..."
if [ -f "data/grantservice.db" ]; then
  DB_SIZE=$(du -h data/grantservice.db | cut -f1)
  echo "‚úì Production database intact: $DB_SIZE"
else
  echo "‚úó ERROR: Production database missing after update!"
  if [ -f "data/grantservice.db.backup" ]; then
    echo "Restoring from backup..."
    cp data/grantservice.db.backup data/grantservice.db
    echo "‚úì Database restored from backup"
  fi
fi
```

## üìö Key Lessons

### Technical Lessons

1. **PYTHONPATH ‚â† File Existence**
   - Correct Python path doesn't help if files don't physically exist
   - Always verify file presence, not just configuration

2. **Git is Your Safety Net**
   - Git repository preserved all deleted files
   - `git restore` is faster and safer than backup restoration
   - Always check `git status` to detect unexpected deletions

3. **Python Import Cache Issues**
   - `__pycache__` directories can mask import problems
   - Always clear cache after file restoration: `find . -type d -name '__pycache__' -exec rm -rf {} +`

4. **Multipage Streamlit Apps**
   - Each page is a separate process with independent imports
   - Import errors affect all pages, not just one
   - Check logs: `journalctl -u service-name --since '1 minute ago'`

### Process Lessons

1. **Automated Verification is Critical**
   - Manual checks are slow and error-prone
   - Headless browser testing catches real user-facing issues
   - File verification should be part of every deployment

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple layers of protection: file checks + auto-restore + monitoring
   - Don't rely on single point of failure (e.g., just PYTHONPATH)

3. **Documentation During Crisis**
   - Document investigation steps as you go
   - Timeline helps identify patterns
   - Commands used become future runbooks

### Investigation Lessons

1. **Start with Facts, Not Assumptions**
   - We assumed PYTHONPATH was wrong
   - Actually files were deleted
   - Checking both local and production revealed the truth

2. **Compare Working vs Broken**
   - Local (working) had all files
   - Production (broken) missing files
   - Side-by-side comparison revealed root cause immediately

3. **Git Status is Diagnostic Gold**
   - `git status` showed all deleted files
   - Faster than manually comparing directories
   - Works even when files are deleted

## üîç Mystery: How Were Files Deleted?

**Still Unknown**: The exact mechanism that deleted the files.

### Possible Causes

1. **Manual Deletion** (accidental)
   ```bash
   rm -rf data/database/*  # Oops!
   ```

2. **Failed Git Operation**
   ```bash
   git checkout -- .  # Could delete tracked files
   git clean -fd      # Deletes untracked, but should preserve tracked
   ```

3. **Deployment Script Bug**
   - Previous version of deploy script?
   - Data migration gone wrong?

4. **Filesystem Issue**
   - Unlikely but possible corruption
   - Disk space issue causing file loss

### Investigation Commands Used
```bash
# Check git log for suspicious operations
git log --all --full-history -- data/database/

# Check bash history for rm commands
grep -i "rm.*database" ~/.bash_history

# Check system logs
journalctl --since '2025-10-02' | grep -i "database"
```

**Note**: Without finding the deletion mechanism, we can't guarantee it won't happen again. The preventive measures will mitigate, but not eliminate, the risk.
