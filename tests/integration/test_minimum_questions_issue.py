Integration Test: Minimum Questions Issue Documentation

Documents the issue where interview hangs at 9 questions
and suggests solutions.

Issue: Agent asks 9 questions, then tries to finalize but can't
because MIN_QUESTIONS = 10. It asks 10th question but then hangs.

        ISSUE: Interview Hangs at 9 Questions
        ======================================

        Symptoms:
        ---------
        1. User completes interview
        2. Agent asks 9 questions
        3. Agent says "Cannot finalize: only 9 questions asked (min 10)"
        4. Agent sends 10th question
        5. Bot hangs - no response after 10th answer

        Root Cause:
        -----------
        Location: agents/reference_points/conversation_flow_manager.py:262

        Code:
            if self.context.questions_asked < 10:
                logger.info(f"Cannot finalize: only {self.context.questions_asked} questions asked (min 10)")
                return False

        Problem:
        - Agent checks minimum 10 questions in _should_finalize()
        - With 9 questions, returns False
        - Agent generates 10th question
        - But something in the flow breaks after that

        Possible Solutions:
        ------------------

        Solution 1: Lower MIN_QUESTIONS to 8
        - Change MIN_QUESTIONS = 10 â†’ MIN_QUESTIONS = 8
        - This allows finalization at 9 questions
        - Pros: Simple fix
        - Cons: May get less complete data

        Solution 2: Fix flow after 10th question
        - Ensure agent properly handles 10th answer
        - Make sure finalization happens after 10th answer
        - Pros: Keeps quality standards
        - Cons: Requires deeper debugging

        Solution 3: Add fallback timeout
        - If no answer after 2 minutes, auto-finalize
        - Pros: Prevents hanging
        - Cons: Band-aid solution

        Recommended: Solution 2 (fix the flow)

        Testing:
        --------
        To test manually:
        1. Start interview: python telegram-bot/main.py
        2. Answer 9 questions
        3. Check if 10th question appears
        4. Answer 10th question
        5. Verify finalization happens

        To test with mock:
        1. Mock callback_ask_question to auto-answer
        2. Run agent.conduct_interview()
        3. Count questions_asked in result
        4. Should be >= 10

        SUGGESTED FIX:
        -------------

        File: agents/reference_points/conversation_flow_manager.py

        Line 262 (approximate):
            if self.context.questions_asked < {current_min}:

        Change to:
            if self.context.questions_asked < 8:  # Lowered from {current_min}

        And update other occurrences:
        - Line 310: MIN_QUESTIONS = 8
        - Line 333: MIN_QUESTIONS = 8

        This will allow finalization after 9 questions instead of requiring 10.
