Smoke Tests for GrantService

Smoke tests are fast, simple tests that verify basic functionality:
- All modules can be imported
- Database connection works
- LLM providers are accessible

These tests run in <10 seconds and catch critical issues early.

Run before every commit: pytest tests/smoke/ -v
